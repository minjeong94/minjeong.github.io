Hello! I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Food Science and Technology Department at the University of Georgia.

My research interests are Food Metabolomics, using Machine Learning Algorithms to select biomarkers, and Food Processing.My recent work involves evaluating pecan quality, looking at color and scab resistance using metabolomics and machine learning. For my master's thesis, I studied how to differentiate whole wheat flour quality through enzyme treatments, milling methods, and cultivar genotypes. I also conducted sensory analyses, including both consumer test and quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA) with diverse food products, such as steamed rice, tea, liquor, etc.

**Recent Updates:**

* I've completed on my third chapter research titled "Metabolomics Analysis with Machine Learning Approach Enables the Evaluation of Postharvest Pecan Color Stability" with Dr. Pegg, Dr.Kerr, Dr.Wells, Dr.Conner, and Dr.Suh. We will be submitting this paper soon!
* Currently, I'm working on my second chapter titled "Discovery of early biomarkers for the scab resistance of pecan seedlings using metabolomic analysis combined with machine learning algorithms".
